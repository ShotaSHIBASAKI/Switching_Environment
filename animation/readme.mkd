# Quasi-stationary distribution
This is an example of two specie dynamics when the switching rate is $\nu=0.1$ and the txoin sensitivities of two species are $\delta=0.2$. 
We will see that time $T_{end}=200$ is enough long to converge a quasi-stationary distribution.

main.c is a code for running the dynamics. Note that in this version, the code saves the dynamics at every time point certain reaction happens. The file sizes would be huge in some cases. For this reason, we show only the 1,000 not 100,000, runs here. Instead of uploading 1,000 files, we provide the histgram of resource or toxin amounts, and two species abundances at time $1,2,...200$ in csv files.

animation.py proviedes functions to draw gif animation.
