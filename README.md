# Intorduction
Codes and data of S. Shibasaki, M. Mobilia and S. Mitri (2020) [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12090).
Here, you can access the programming codes (in Python and C language) and csv files used in the above manuscript. However, we cannot depositi row data (i.e., dynamics in each simulation) due to the limitation of the file sizes. Please contaact Shota Shibasaki if you need such row data.
To run C language codes, you need to have "Mt.h".



# interaction_analysis



# diversity_analysis
In this file, you can see four programming codes (incl. "MT.h") and two data folders (beta diversity and Species_richness).

"parm_geenrators.c" generates parameter values of each species in each run. You need to run this code before running the below codes.
"main_diversity.c" performs Glispies algorithm with given numbers of speices and compounds in a system.
